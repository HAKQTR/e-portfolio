																									<H4>Cybersecurity as a Global Issue</H4>

																							<P>Cybersecurity is inexorable and central to the success of all organizations. Contemporary companies by nature explore digital technologies in view of their role as an enabler of commercial transactions. Companies also invest in cybersecurity measures in order to exploit the economic benefits of digital technologies. The evolving nature of threats that contemporary businesses face further necessitates investments in cybersecurity. Ultimately, the implications of success are dire and cause untold harm to organizations.</P>
																							
																							<P>Digital security is increasingly important to all organizations. It is a mainstay for contemporary organizations, which typically gather troves of data, process it, store it in data repositories, and distribute it through online networks with upstream suppliers and customers among other stakeholders. Companies also invest significant resources in hardware and software purchases and devote monumental amounts towards their maintenance. At the same time, these companies have to contend with omnipresent threats such as malware, unauthorized access, and physical threats from malicious third parties (Zimmermann and Renaud, 2019). Moreover, ubiquitous network access and an exponential increase in the number of intelligent and internet-connected devices have increased the security risks with which companies have to contend (Walker-Roberts et al., 2020). Consequently, they have to employ countermeasures and safeguards to reduce the risk of attacks and to counter them effectively when they materialize.</P>
																							
																							<P>Companies also have to invest adequately in information security in order to accrue the economic benefits of digitalization. At the outset, they have to safeguard their systems and resolve any security vulnerabilities promptly in order to minimize their economic losses. For example, security threats can undermine and halt organizations’ critical functions such as finance, operations, customer service, and marketing. Companies that demonstrate the ability to protect their technology assets also witness a higher level of confidence among customers. (Vasiu, I. and Vasiu, L., 2018). Further, companies that thwart attempts to exploit and compromise their systems effectively experience fewer losses associated with downtime. At the same time, they reduce their exposure to imminent security threats, both known and unknown, and can therefore vie effectively for market share in highly contested markets (Loukaka & Rahman, 2017; Vasiu, I. and Vasiu, L., 2018). In summary, cybersecurity plays an indubitable role as a driver and determinant of business success.</P>
																							
																							<P>The current security environment obligates companies to buttress their security posture or augment their protection profile. At the outset, the scale and intensity of cyber threats have expanded. Threat agents have also developed sophisticated tools and techniques that warrant greater security and managerial attention (Loukaka & Rahman, 2017). Moreover, attackers have developed numerous ways to attack or compromise companies’ information systems. These include phishing attacks, social engineering, backdoors and bugs, malicious code, spyware, and intrusions from unauthorized individuals (tailgating), among others (Cihan and Akleylek, 2019; Walker-Roberts, et al., 2020). This signifies that companies should respond appropriately by implementing adequate security measures and standards. For example, many companies employ multiple layers of security, ranging from security policies, employee training, physical security, and installation of antimalware technologies (Vasiu, I. and Vasiu, L., 2018). In short, the current nature of security threats characterized by novel and emerging threats obligates companies to invest in corresponding countermeasures.</P>
																							
																							<P>The materialization of cyber threats portends adverse implications for organizations. Firstly, theft of data from organizations systems or networks undermines customers’ confidence in organizations’ information systems. Secondly, when attackers mount successful attacks such as Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) attacks, they damage organizations firmware irreparably. Thirdly, successful intrusions and information system breaches instigate lawsuits against the organization and result in significant financial liabilities. Notably, the fact that more people within organizations currently have legitimate access to information systems heightens the likelihood of internal security threats (Vasiu, I. and Vasiu, L., 2018). For example, some employees can inadvertently cause security breaches while others may act maliciously by selling data or sabotaging their organizations’ information infrastructure. Therefore, failure to identify and invest sufficiently in system security exposes companies to reputational, financial, and legal risks.</P>
																							
																							<P>From the foregoing, cyber Security is presently a global issue, and that all organizations that harness technology as an enabler of diverse business processes should invest in risk mitigation measures. It is imperative that companies employ optimal risk control strategies that are commensurate with their degree of risk exposure in order to safeguard their assets. Ultimately, organizations that fail to install various defences to forestall threats to data and infrastructure inevitably expose themselves to attendant consequences such as brand dilution and costly lawsuits.</P>

																							<P>Thank you Loannis for your post, I do agree with all of the points you have made we do need to attract people to the field at a younger age and it truly has become a broad field where people ( the human element ) are required from all fields and backgrounds. </P>

																							<P>it is said that many regulations and geo-restrictions plus laws would get into the way of creating alliances with different industries, academia, and governments. If anything it seems that many are actually looking into segmenting their networks to do the complete opposite in order to have more control. for example, as to (Kukkola,2021)  Russia has already implemented its own closed circuit of the internet to control inbound and outbound traffic and mitigate cyber threats since 2019. while you still have projects such as OSINT and OWSAP that are trying their best to create open frameworks and list vulnerabilities so that everyone can use them. however, the shared information can also be misused. a total re-vamp of the way we think to mitigate the risks of cyber threats is truly required as you stated.</P>

											<P>Security Technologies</P>

											<P>Modern-day organizations are striving to remain operational and profitable. However, the rising rate of cybercriminals with attempts to penetrate and compromise the IT infrastructure is a threat to productivity and the ability to ensure privacy. As a result, organizations are forced to consider using up-to-date security technologies to respond to threats of cyberattacks. The two security technologies used to mitigate network-related threats include the firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS).</P>
											
											
											
											<P>A firewall is a security technology that helps protect the network by monitoring and controlling the traffic based on the set security rules. Firewalls work by limiting access to an operating system or nodes connected to a network only to authorized users (Dandamudi & Eltaeib, 2015). The proxy firewall is the best type of firewall to consider in protecting the network against threats from attackers. The proxy firewall works by reproducing the application layer functionality to decode packets collectively (Hayajneh, Mohd, Itradat, & Quttoum, 2013). The decoded packets are then examined to determine if they belong to a valid request. Hence, this firewall connects users and the application server while protecting either side for direct connection.</P>
											
											
											
											<P>The advantage of using a proxy firewall is that it provides a comprehensive traffic examination, resulting in improved network security. Another advantage of a proxy firewall is that it is more difficult to discover the network due to the inability of cybercriminals to receive packets from the targeted system (Mukkamala & Rajendran, 2020). Despite these strengths, a proxy firewall exposes the system to the risk of delays and jittering. The advanced security level provided for the firewall may compromise the network, affecting its performance (Hayajneh, Mohd, Itradat, & Quttoum, 2013). Moreover, any form of disturbance to the firewall may result in network malfunction, threatening normal operations. Consequently, organizations seeking to install a proxy firewall for network protection should avoid interfering with the firewall for best performance.</P>
											
											
											
											<P>An intrusion Detection System is another security technology employed in mitigating network-related issues. IDS technology offers network protection by monitoring all the traffic entering the system to ensure security (Jabez & Muthukumar, 2015). The Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is the ideal type of IDS that can be employed to address network issues. HIDS assumes a layered approach in mitigating threats to the network. This technology combines system data with network information to obtain a comprehensive view of the network system (Tesfahun & Bhaskari, 2015). One of the key strengths of HIDS is that it can analyze encrypted data decrypted by the host. HIDS can also detect attacks that are not easily detectable by other security systems (Chauhan & Chandra, 2015). However, HIDS cannot continue running after an attack brings down the operating system. Besides, an organization has to install HIDS on every system to ensure full protection. Thus, as companies consider HIDS in network protection, there is a need to backup log information on an off-site system.</P>
											
											
											
											<P>Conclusively, firewalls and IDS are vital to network security technologies employed in today’s modern world. In particular, the proxy firewall offers the most effective protection of the network system. Similarly, HIDS provides the most robust network security in the IDS category. However, the two are also associated with various weaknesses. Whereas proxy firewall may cause network malfunctioning, HIDS does not offer protection once the operating system has been brought down. Therefore, organizations should weigh their preferences against the available network security technologies before settling on one. </P>

													<P>I agree with you that network firewall as a security technology can be made effective by ensuring proper configuration through the implementation of proper policies, managing accessibility as well as the traffic. As per your observation, the water treatment plant has two major segments which include the office network and the operation network. Each one of them has its own unique set of duties. I agree with both the strengths and weaknesses outlined as being associated with the system.</P> 
													<P>However, while the PLC system is well protected with two layers of firewalls, there is also the concern of cost implications including setting up and maintenance. According to Shinder (2017), an average enterprise firewall costs approximately $25,000 to set up and run. Furthermore, the use of firewalls from multiple vendors could also raise concerns on issues such as compatibility and the quality of the network.</P>
													
													<P> Obtaining components that are compatible from different vendors could also prove to be quite complicated (Lutkevich, 2021). However, I disagree with the idea that using the same type of firewall from a single vendor could cause security risks. On the contrary, it is likely to improve the security as many points of weaknesses that result from the use of different firewalls will be reduced (Howard, & Lipner, 2006).</P>

													<P>I agree with you on the observation that the pandemic indeed forced businesses to make changes to their mode of operation.  When many countries applied lockdowns as a containment measure, some businesses resorted to working from home as survival mechanism to keep things running. According to Irwin (2021), this move posed new security threats that some of these organizations had managed to weather down in their work environments.</P> 

													<P>These included unsecured networks, phishing scams and the risk posed by the use of personal devices. I agree with Gartner on the possibility that 60% of the current VPNs used by enterprises will be phased out by the year 2023. Instead, they will be replaced with use Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) systems. Even as the world comes out the pandemic, many businesses have adopted work from home as their new approach for several reasons. It cuts down on the cost of operation and is also highly productive.</P>
													
													<P>Consequently, working from home could be the new norm in business operations (Check Point, 2021). ZTNA will offer more effective endpoint security compared to the current VPNs thus making them the security devices of the future. Furthermore, the obligation to provide VPNs is on the employer (Data Privacy Manager, 2010). Therefore, we are likely to see more investment and innovation towards improving what is currently available.</P>

															<P>It is true that Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN) and blockchain technologies are used by organizations to secure their networks and cloud infrastructure. According to Harmening (2017), they have proved to be particularly important as businesses migrate their operations to more secure systems on the cloud. Consequently, various security threats have also emerged as these new systems are adopted. I agree with you that SSL VPN is an effective solution towards addressing the issue of unauthorized access. It ensures that only users with the right privileges are able to access the system. Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN enables the authentication and encryption of data packets towards the provision of secure and encrypted communication between two or more computers (Alshamrani, 2014). I agree with you that one of the main advantage of SSL VPN is that it is limited to web applications. It also prevents take overs by attackers on the entire network. Blockchain technology on the other hand uses public ledger to implement transactions thus protecting networks from attacks. One of the main reasons why blockchain technology is a game changer in cloud security is the fact that each block is independent (Park, & Park, 2017). Even if a hacker was to succeed in attacking one block, the others would remain unharmed.</P>

											<button class="accordion">Summary Post</button>
											<div class="panel">
											</br>


																										<P>Modern-day organizations endeavour  to remain operational and profitable, as a result they are forced to apply up-to-date security technologies to respond to cybersecurity threats. Considering a defence in depth approach two technologies that can be used are firewalls and Intrusion detection systems (IDS).</P>

																										<P>A firewall helps protect the network by monitoring and controlling traffic. While an IDS is another security technology employed to mitigate network related issues by monitoring all traffic as well.</P>
																										
																										<P>(Paintsil, 2002) agrees that IDS have weakness and tends to introduce false positives even though IDS’s provide analysts with information that is of value to understanding the strategies of a cyber-attack.  While (Tolofari, 2022) stated that the IDS solutions tend to be based on two categories; signature based and behavioural based both can detect an alert, it is of more value to look into Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to prevent intrusions and have a better overall security posture.</P>
																										
																										<P>(Sodabe, 2022) agrees with Tolofari and that IPS are of value and offers more then traditional IDS, and I agree with his statement. Especially since both IPS and IDS complement each other.</P>
																										
																										<P>Moreover, (Ajayi,2022) pointed out that security experts have to make use and develop new ways to make a firewall and IDS do what is required of them more effectively. I do agree with all the points stated.</P>
																										
																										<P>In conclusion, security technologies may vary from firewalls, IDS’s and IPS’s even though they function with rules and based on the actual network traffic. They still have weaknesses. Therefore, should weigh there preference against the available network security technologies before settling on one and if possible I would moreover recommend a defence  in depth approach to have multiple technologies but at the same time to balance it out with the overall total cost of ownership of the same stated technologies.</P>
